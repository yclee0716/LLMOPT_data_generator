# LLM Optimization Data Entries Generator
You can use this repo to generate data entries that you need. Please remember to generate the categories.json first, which can be accomplished by running `generate_categories`. You can feel free to add more problem categories as you need.
The `generate.py` will generate batches of file sets, which you can change the problem type in the code.
The `generate_5files.py` will randomly choose problem types and real-world scenarios from `categories.json`.
